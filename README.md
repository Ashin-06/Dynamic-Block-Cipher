# Dynamic-Block-Cipher
: A symmetric block cipher implementation designed for high-entropy text encryption. This project features a custom Generalized Feistel Network (GFN) architecture that supports dynamic key lengths and large block sizes (up to 4096 bits) to resist standard cryptanalytic attacks.
